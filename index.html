                                        <p>In the pre-colonial Philippines, villages were governed by a set of laws that
                                            <br>included civil and criminal provisions. Usually, it was the datu and the 
                                            <br>village that promulgated such rules, which were then to the people by a town
                                            <br>crier called the umalohokan.The Philippines had a very advanced civilization
                                            <br>long before the arrival of the Spaniards. When the colonizers arrived,
                                            <br>everything that contradicted their own system had to be removed. 
                                            <br>Sculptures, texts, religious ceremonies, and virtually 
                                            anything else deemed obscene, evil or a threat to their rule were eliminated.

                                            In terms of food, our forefathers did not suffer from any lack thereof.
                                            Blessed with such a resource-rich country, 
                                            they had enough for themselves and their families.
                                            Forests, rivers, and seas yielded plentiful supplies of meat, fish, 
                                            and other foodstuffs.

                                            Polygamists in pre-colonial India were allowed to divorce, and 
                                            women could choose how many children they wanted. Sexuality was 
                                            not as suppressed, and no premium was given to virginity before 
                                            marriage. Homosexuals were also largely tolerated, 
                                            seeing as how some of the babaylans were actually men in drag.

                                            During Spanish colonialism of the Philippines, the government 
                                            was divided into two branches: executive and judiciary. There was 
                                            no legislative branch on that time since the laws of the islands were 
                                            coming from Spain . In the Philippines, the only laws enacted are 
                                            those mandated by the Governor General. The Governor General led the 
                                            government at the time. He was regarded as the King's and Spain's 
                                            representative. He is the highest ranking officer on the island and is
                                            in charge of enforcing mother country laws.

                                            He also has a power to appoint or relieve officer in the parish,
                                            except those appointed by the king of Spain.
                                            "Alcalde Mayor" had both the executive and judicial power. In 1886, 
                                            their executive power was abolished but their judicial powers remain. 
                                            Filipino American National Historical Society declared October Filipino 
                                            American History Month to preserve and promote Filipino-American history.
                                            Ocampo noted that when Filipinos immigrated to the U.S., many would end up at 
                                            churches and meet Mexican Americans rather than other Asian Americans.

                                            The 1943 Constitution was the constitution of the Japanese-sponsored 
                                            Second Republic of the Philippines (1943-1945). It was recognized as 
                                            legitimate and binding only in Japanese-controlled areas but was ignored
                                            by the United States government and the Philippine Commonwealth government 
                                            in-exile. In June 1943, the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence
                                            (PCPI) was created to draft a new constitution. The Japanese monitored the drafting
                                            of the constitution and instructed the PCPI that the constitution should conform
                                            with the principles of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

                                            The invasion of the Philippines started on December 8, 1941, ten hours after 
                                            the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the
                                            Philippines withdrew to Java. Douglas MacArthur escaped Corregidor on the night of
